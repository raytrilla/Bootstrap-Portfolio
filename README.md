In this challenge I will be building a portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework.

This portfolio is designed to include the following components using Bootstrap:

A Navigation bar  
- Included a navigation menu at the top with applicable links that navigate to the appropriate sections.

A hero section
- Included a jumbotron featuring my picture, my name, and a opening line to my portfolio.

A work section  
- Used bootstrap cards and displayed each project in a grid.
- Included brief descriptions of each project.
- Each project links to my deployed project work and placeholder inplace until I have more projects to add.

A skills section
- Listing out the skills I expect to learn from the bootcamp.

An about / contact section.
- Included a contact me and about me section but in different rows.
    
A footer section.
- All hyperlinks having a hover effect.
- All buttons displaying a box shadow upon hover.
